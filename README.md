# Airport
ASP.NET Web API project which manages an airport flights and terminals using the next technologies:
Asp .Net-Core for the backend and Angular for the frontend.
Also I'm using WebSocket(SignalR library) to send data in real-time from the backend server to the frontend.
I emphasized the subject of architecture (Unit of work, event-driven, SOLID) in the project for clean, maintainability and readable code.
